# One or more tasks selected by the user will add required plugins and set

tasks:
    - wrf     # WRF meteo inputs
    #- wrf_rad # WRF radiation inputs
    #- icon2   # ICON inputs
    #- aladin  # Aladin inputs
    #- camx    # CAMx chemistry inputs
    #- cams    # CAMS chemistry inputs

# Default workflow. Currently no need to have separate workflows per task.
# Advnanced users may skip some steps in special cases.
workflow:
    - check_config
