    # Method of stretching vertical levels before vertical interpolation in
    # order to match the target (high-resolution) terrain, while limiting the
    # propagation of surface features to higher levels. May be one of:
    # universal:    A universal method where levels above transition_level are
    #               kept unmodified while the levels below are stretched
    #               gradually
    # hybrid:       Use the WRF hybrid vertical coordinate system from the
    #               WRFOUT input files to stretch the levels. WARNING: the WRF
    #               model must be configured to using hybrid levels, not sigma
    #               leves, there is no check for this!
    # sigma:        Use the WRF sigma levels system from the WRFOUT input
    #               files to stretch the levels. WARNING: the WRF model must be
    #               configured to using sigma levels, not hybrid leves, there
    #               is no check for this!
